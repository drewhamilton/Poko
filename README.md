# Poko
[![](https://github.com/drewhamilton/Poko/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/drewhamilton/Poko/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amain)

Poko is a Kotlin compiler plugin that makes writing and maintaining data model classes for public
APIs easy. Like with normal Kotlin data classes, all you have to do is provide properties in your
class's primary constructor. With the `@Poko` annotation, this compiler plugin automatically
generates `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` functions. Poko is compatible with all Kotlin
Multiplatform targets.

## Use
Mark your class as a `@Poko class` instead of a `data class`:
```kotlin
@Poko class MyData(
    val int: Int,
    val requiredString: String,
    val optionalString: String?,
)
```

And reap the benefits of a readable `toString` and working `equals` and `hashCode`. Unlike normal
data classes, no `copy` or `componentN` functions are generated.

Like normal data classes, Poko classes must have at least one property in their primary constructor.
Non-property parameters in the primary constructor are ignored, as are non-constructor properties.
Any of the three generated functions can be overridden manually, in which case Poko will not
generate that function but will still generate the non-overridden functions. Using array properties
is not recommended, and if they are used, it is recommended to override `equals` and `hashCode`
manually.

### Arrays
By default, Poko does nothing to inspect the contents of array properties. [This aligns with data
classes](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2015/09/feedback-request-limitations-on-data-classes/#Appendix.Comparingarrays).

Poko consumers can change this behavior on a per-property basis with the `@ArrayContentBased`
annotation. On properties of a typed array type, this annotation will generate a `contentDeepEquals`
check. On properties of a primitive array type, this annotation will generate a `contentEquals`
check. And on properties of type `Any` or of a generic type, this annotation will generate a `when`
statement that disambiguates the many array types at runtime and uses the appropriate
`contentDeepEquals` or `contentEquals` check. In all cases, the corresponding content-based
`hashCode` and `toString` are generated for the property as well.

Using arrays as properties in data types is still not generally recommended: arrays are mutable, and
mutating data can affect the results of `equals` and `hashCode` over time, which is generally
unexpected. For this reason, `@ArrayContentBased` should only be used in very performance-sensitive
APIs.

### Annotation
By default, the `dev.drewhamilton.poko.Poko` annotation is used to mark classes for Poko generation.
If you prefer, you can create a different annotation and supply it to the Gradle  plugin.

```groovy
apply plugin: "dev.drewhamilton.poko"
poko {
  pokoAnnotation.set "com.example.MyDataAnnotation"
}
```

Note that this only affects the primary marker annotation. Supplemental annotations such as
`@ArrayContentBased` do not support customization.

Poko is available on Maven Central. It is experimental, and the API may undergo breaking changes
before version 1.0.0. Kotlin compiler plugins in general are experimental and new versions of Kotlin
might break something in this compiler plugin.

Since the Kotlin compiler has frequent breaking changes, different versions of Kotlin are
exclusively compatible with specific versions of Poko.

| Kotlin version  | Poko version |
|-----------------|--------------|
| 1.9.0 – 1.9.20  | 0.15.0       |
| 1.8.20 – 1.8.22 | 0.13.1       |
| 1.8.0 – 1.8.10  | 0.12.0       |
| 1.7.0 – 1.7.21  | 0.11.0       |
| 1.6.20 – 1.6.21 | 0.10.0       | 
| 1.6.0 – 1.6.10  | 0.9.0        |
| 1.5.0 – 1.5.31  | 0.8.1        |
| 1.4.30 – 1.4.32 | 0.7.4        |
| 1.4.20 – 1.4.21 | 0.5.0*       |
| 1.4.0 – 1.4.10  | 0.3.1*       |
| 1.3.72          | 0.2.4*       |

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's Snapshots
repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/#view-repositories;snapshots~browsestorage).

To use Poko, apply the Gradle plugin in your project:
```kotlin
// Root project:
plugins {
    id("dev.drewhamilton.poko") apply false
}

// Per module:
plugins {
    id("dev.drewhamilton.poko")
}
```

\*Versions prior to 0.7.0 use plugin name `dev.drewhamilton.extracare`.

## To-do
* Generate an inner Builder class
* Propagate the constructor default values to the Builder 
* Mark the constructor as private
* Generate a top-level DSL initializer
* Write an IDE plugin?
